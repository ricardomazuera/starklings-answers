# Starklings Answers

To learn [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/), I decided to do the exercises on [starklinks.app](https://starklings.app/), which is a platform where you can practice this new programming language that allows you to build scalable dApps with the power of validity proofs.

## How to run the tests?

    git clone https://github.com/ricardomazuera/starklings-answers.git
    cd starklings-answers
    scarb cairo-test

### Disclaimer
This repository is not designed to run all files continuously. This is because some exercises are designed to be tested and others to run the program, that is why according to the exercise, you will have to go to [lib.cairo](https://github.com/ricardomazuera/starklings-answers/blob/main/src/lib.cairo) and only leave uncommented the exercise you want to test and run the required command. 

#### How to run an exercise?

    scarb cairo-run
